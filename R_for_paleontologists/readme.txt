This folder contains course scripts and data for a brief introduction to R for paleontologists.

Lessons are numbered, and each lesson will generally have an associated .R file containing the entire code with detailed annotations, and a .pdf file containing a rendering of the lecture presentation.

lecture videos will be released via youtube and will be linked here, links TBA

The scripts are designed to be fully executable without modification, so in the event you want to skip the entire contents of one document, but still want to make sure that you have all the necessary files and objects generated by it, you can simply execute source("filename.R") inside R to execute the entire script.

Note that the # is used for commenting (preventing the execution of) code in R (as in some other scripting languages), so be sure not to remove any of them from the script files before executing unless you know what you are doing!

Best of luck and I hope this course is useful to you!
