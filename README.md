# R-scripts

This repository is a public archive of various custom R functions Iâ€™ve come up with (some more useful than others). This includes tools for analysis and plotting and various helper functions for more or less specialized applications. They are in various different states of documentation, but I am aiming to include roxygen-format documentation entries within all new (and eventually also old) script files.
Some of these functions might eventually be migrated to a published package, others already have been (to gdi or paleoDiv)
