# R-scripts

This repository is intended as a public archive for various custom scripts defining functions in R, in the hopes that they might be useful to someone. Documentation and explanations may be a bit subpar, but Iâ€™ll try to briefly explain essential functionalities as comments. Some of these might end up in a package some day, if there is demand. If there are any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me!
